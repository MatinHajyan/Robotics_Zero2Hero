# Tasks format

## Task format
1. Define Learning Goals for Each Challenge: What skill or concept the student should take away.
How it connects to real-world applications.

2. provide challange/question + hints/keywords: provide guiding questions and keywords and hints as extra (optional) guidance
Instead of hinting at git rebase, ask:

## Expected Procedure

1. State a Hypothesis Before Experimenting: write down a hypothesis before running any test or writing code

2. Small-Step Iterations: quick, small experiments instead of trying to solve everything at once.
Example: Before debugging a ROS node, make the student write a minimal script that isolates the problem.

## Solution/Report format
1. Structured Documentation Format: 

* Problem
* Hypothesis
* Experimentation & Research (updates + dates + details)
* Solution & Implementation (final solution)
* Results (repot, code, docs, images, videos, logs, etc)
* Conclusion

best practice: git standards, python, c++, clean code, documentation, commenting, doxygen, modular code, project structure, configs, google style c++, 
tools: Vim, Tmux, keyboard shortcuts, 
docker and virtual env: cross-platform
visualization: simulation (carla)
