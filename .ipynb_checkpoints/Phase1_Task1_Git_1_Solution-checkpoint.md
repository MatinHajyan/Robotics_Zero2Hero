**Challenge 1: Understanding Version Control


1.What is version control?

Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.



Why is version control important in software development?

-This allows software developers to see the entire history of who changed what at any given time â€” and roll back from the current version to an earlier version if they need to. It also creates a single source of truth.
-Version control (or source control or revision control) serves as a safety net to protect the source code from irreparable harm, giving the development team the freedom to experiment without fear of causing damage or creating code conflicts.
